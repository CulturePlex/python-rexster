python-rexster
==============

:synopsis: Implements a client over Rexster (https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/) providing the Python developer an easy way to interact with the databases supported.

The layer follows the pyblueprints graph model interface letting the programmer work in the same way, no matter which underlying graph database is being used.
